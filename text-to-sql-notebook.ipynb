    "- Python 3.x installed\n",
    "- Access to an AWS account with permissions to use Amazon Bedrock and access to Anthropic Claude 2.1 and Claude 3.\n",
    "- The following repo: `https://github.com/aws-samples/industrial-data-store-simulation-chatbot` with this notebook in the same project directory\n",
    "- (recommended) If running on Amazon SageMaker Studio Jupyter Lab, a `ml.t3.medium` is recommended. This is the default instance type for CPU-based SageMaker images, and is available as part of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free)"

You will then be able to leverage these learnings to access other industrial data stores and build your own LLM-powered application"

    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) have good reasoning skills and are able to execute multi-step tasks, but to be useful in industrial applications, they require access to your data. LLMs are not designed to analyzed data by being directly fed information from a database. Instead, one can leverage the reasoning and code generation ability of the foundation model to come up with a plan to answer the question. Then, it can write code to retrieve this information from the database and finally use the information retrieved to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows users that would not have previously been able to access this data because of the pre-existing requirement of not only being able to write SQL queries, but also needing to understand the database metadata and table relationship. Additionally, data now becomes accessible in a human-friendly chat interface instead of having to access a specific tool such as a proprietary client tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interact with a Manufacturing Execution System (MES)\n",
    "In this workshop, you will be creating a simulation Manufacturing Execution System (MES) represented as a relational database. MES are designed to facilitate the coordination and optimization of the production process, tracking key components of a manufacturing execution system.\n",
    "\n",
    "They typically work closely with other industrial systems such as ERP (where work orders will come from), SCADA or other control software (where the process is controlled and operational time-series data from PLCs are generated) and Data Historians (where operational time-series data from machines and analytics are stored). \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity sake, the simulation MES is a self-contained system, but the same concept can be extended to interact with several systems by creating agents that connect to those various systems. It can also be applied to other industrial data stores. We will dive deeper into this topic below"

    "This concludes the workshop, where we successfully implemented functions to ask questions against the MES, generate valid SQL queries using the LLM, execute those queries against the database, and generate human-readable responses based on the result set. Throughout the workshop, we focused on creating a prompt template that included the database schema, sample data, and clear instructions for the LLM to generate the desired SQL queries. We also addressed challenges related to time-based queries by including the current date and time in the prompt. Finally, we created a new prompt template to generate NLP responses based on the SQL query results, providing a more user-friendly output for the chatbot functionality."
