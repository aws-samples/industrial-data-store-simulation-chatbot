    "\n",
    "Strands Agents SDK makes it easy to customize behavior, switch models, and manage agent lifecycle. Let's explore the key configuration options:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔧 Core Configuration Options:**\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Choose from Claude, Nova, or other supported models\n",

    "### Multi-agent pattern\n",
    "**Agents as Tools with Strands Agents SDK**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Agents as Tools\" is an architectural pattern in AI systems where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A primary \"orchestrator\" agent handles user interaction and determines which specialized agent to call\n",
    "- Specialized \"tool agents\" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics human team dynamics, where a manager coordinates specialists, each bringing unique expertise to solve complex problems. Rather than a single agent trying to handle everything, tasks are delegated to the most appropriate specialized agent.\n",
    "Key Benefits and Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"Agents as Tools\" pattern offers several advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation of concerns: Each agent has a focused area of responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain\n",
    "- Hierarchical delegation: The orchestrator decides which specialist to invoke, creating a clear chain of command\n",
    "- Modular architecture: Specialists can be added, removed, or modified independently without affecting the entire system\n",
    "- Improved performance: Each agent can have tailored system prompts and tools optimized for its specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strands Agents SDK Best Practices for Agent Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing the \"Agents as Tools\" pattern with Strands Agents SDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear tool documentation: Write descriptive docstrings that explain the agent's expertise\n",
    "- Focused system prompts: Keep each specialized agent tightly focused on its domain\n",
    "- Proper response handling: Use consistent patterns to extract and format responses\n",
    "- Tool selection guidance: Give the orchestrator clear criteria for when to use each specialized agent\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Learning Objective\n",
    "Understand the traditional approach to AI-powered database querying and its limitations compared to modern agent frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 The Traditional Tool-Calling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bedrock Converse API with tools represents the \"first generation\" of AI-powered database interaction. While more advanced than pure SQL, it still has significant limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Advantages over Manual SQL:**\n",
    "- Natural language input instead of SQL syntax\n",
    "- Automatic tool selection and parameter passing\n",
    "- Model can reason about which tools to use\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Limitations of Tool-Calling Approach:**\n",
    "- **No Conversation Memory**: Each query starts fresh, no context from previous interactions\n",
    "- **Basic Error Handling**: Simple error messages without intelligent recovery\n",
    "- **Manual Tool Configuration**: Developers must define all tools and their schemas\n",
    "- **No Learning**: System doesn't improve from user interactions\n",
    "- **Limited Reasoning**: Single-step tool calls, no complex multi-step analysis\n",
    "- **No Domain Expertise**: Generic AI without manufacturing-specific knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 How Tool-Calling Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional tool-calling process follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Question** → Natural language input\n",
    "2. **Model Analysis** → AI decides which tools to use\n",
    "3. **Tool Execution** → System executes the requested tools\n",
    "4. **Result Processing** → Model formats the tool results\n",
    "5. **Response Generation** → Final answer based on tool outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎓 Educational Note**: This approach works well for simple queries but struggles with complex manufacturing analysis that requires multi-step reasoning, domain expertise, and conversation context.\n",

    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Manual SQL | Tool-Calling API | Modern Agents |\n",
    "|--------|------------|------------------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Input** | SQL syntax | Natural language | Natural language |\n",

    "2. **Medium**: Cross-table analysis (\"Which work center is most efficient?\")\n",
    "3. **Complex**: Multi-domain correlation (\"How does equipment downtime affect quality?\")\n",

    "## Conclusion: The Future of Manufacturing Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this comprehensive comparison, we've seen how AI agents using the **Strands Agents SDK** represent a fundamental shift in manufacturing data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Manual SQL to Intelligent Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Approach Challenges:**\n",
    "- Required deep SQL and database schema knowledge\n",
    "- Manual error handling and debugging\n",
    "- Static visualization choices\n",
    "- No contextual manufacturing guidance\n",
    "- Time-intensive development process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Agent Advantages:**\n",
    "- Natural language interface accessible to all users\n",
    "- Intelligent error recovery with educational feedback\n",
    "- AI-powered visualization selection\n",
    "- Manufacturing domain expertise built-in\n",
    "- Dramatic reduction in time-to-insight\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Democratization**: From SQL experts only → Anyone can analyze manufacturing data\n",
    "2. **Speed**: From hours of development → Seconds of natural language interaction\n",
    "3. **Intelligence**: From static queries → Multi-step reasoning and insights\n",
    "4. **Education**: From trial-and-error → Guided learning and best practices\n",
    "5. **Context**: From isolated queries → Conversation-aware analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Manufacturing Operations Hub Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcased components from a production-ready system that includes:\n",
    "- **Strands Agents SDK** for robust agent framework\n",
    "- **Agent-as-Tools Pattern** for clean integration\n",
    "- **Intelligent Error Handling** with recovery suggestions\n",
    "- **Multi-Domain Expertise** across production, quality, equipment, and inventory\n",
    "- **Educational Guidance** that teaches manufacturing concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations implementing AI agent approaches see:\n",
    "- **Faster Decision Making**: Real-time insights instead of waiting for reports\n",
    "- **Broader Data Access**: Non-technical users can explore manufacturing data\n",
    "- **Improved Operations**: Proactive insights lead to better manufacturing outcomes\n",
    "- **Reduced Training Costs**: No need for extensive SQL training programs\n",
    "- **Scalable Intelligence**: Manufacturing expertise scales across the organization\n",
