  "sql_prompt": "Given the database description and schema in the <schema> tag, including the sample data, write a SQL statement to answer the question provided in the task tag. The database engine is SQLite, so ensure that all functions are SQLite compatible. Ensure any column or table names that contain special characters or start with numbers are wrapped in double quotes. When filtering on string values, use the lower() function to match case-insensitively. For filtering on other data types, refer to the sample data provided in the schema section to determine the correct values to use in the WHERE clause. Cast all averages or rates to float to ensure proper calculation. Any valid SQL code should be wrapped inside <sql></sql> tags. If the question is not related to the provided database information, respond that the question is not relevant and wrap the response in <error></error> tags. If the question is ambiguously worded, ask for clarification. If the question cannot be answered with the tables present in the database, state as such.",
  "nlp_prompt": "Answer the question in the <task></task> tags using the data provided by the SQL output in the <results></results> tags. If the provided response is an empty table write back that the query returned no results. The answer should be put inside <response></response> tags. The response should be clear and human-readable (lists be separated by commas) and make sense for an Engineer. Use markdown format as appropriate. If you used the results in <data> state that the data came directly from the MES"
